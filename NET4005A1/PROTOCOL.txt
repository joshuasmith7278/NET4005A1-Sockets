The protocol will transfer a file from the local directory of the server application, to the current directory the client
application is ran from. The server must be running before any file requests can be handled.

Set up:

Server Terminal :

W:\NET4005\Assignment1> java myfileserver.java 

Client Terminal:

C:\Users\joshu> java W:\NET4005\Assignment1\myfileclient.java localhost 8000 pic.png


This will download pic.png from W:\NET4005\Assigments1 and write the file to C:\Users\joshu

The desired file must exist in the W:\NET4005\Assigments1 to be downloaded to the client.


You must specify the 3 required arguments in the client execution. (Server hostname, server port, filename)







First we create a Stream Socket server to listen to 
port 8000 on the server application. We create a Socket 
between any application 

On the client application, we create a Socket with the 
parameters of the Stream Socket Server (localhost, 8000)
